# DuckyShow

This repository contains a collection of scripts (e.g., for BadUSB devices like the USB Rubber Ducky) designed for educational purposes and security awareness demonstrations. The scripts showcase various automation and payload concepts.

## This collection includes examples that demonstrate:

- System Automation: Opening, closing, and interacting with applications.
- Data Exfiltration: Simulating how a file can be created and uploaded to an external service.
- Antivirus Testing: Triggering an antivirus response using the standard EICAR test file.

## Prerequisites
- A BadUSB device (e.g., USB Rubber Ducky, Flipper Zero).
- An authorized and isolated environment for testing.

## How to Use
1) Select a script from the repository.
2) Use the appropriate compiler/tool to convert the script into a payload file (e.g., inject.bin).
3) Deploy the payload on a machine that you own or have explicit permission to test on.
